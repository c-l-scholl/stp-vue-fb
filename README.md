# stp-vue-fb
## Project setup

If interested in picking up this project, run the following commands in your terminal once and you will be all set.  

First: 
```
npm install
```
This is a function needed to help with other installations, including allowing to run the server.  

## Other installations
Next: 
```
npm install vuex@next --save

npm install firebase
```
This first downloads the most recent version of Vue and then installs firebase, our data storage mechanism.  


### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
This creates a local server used to run the website.  

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
Lastly, this optional step for production creates a build directory with a production build of the app. 

Now, you are all set to continue editing our webapp.
